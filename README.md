System Health Monitor

System Health Monitor is a simple, yet effective Bash script designed to monitor the health of your system. The script collects key system metrics including disk space usage, RAM and CPU consumption, and network connectivity. It then logs these results to a file with the current date, making it easy to monitor system performance over time.
Features

    üöÄ Disk Space Monitoring: Check the available disk space on your system.

    üíª RAM Usage: Monitor the current RAM usage in human-readable format.

    ‚öôÔ∏è CPU Usage: Display the CPU usage for efficient resource monitoring.

    üåê Network Connectivity: Test internet connectivity by pinging an external server (Google).

    üìù Log Results: Automatically save the results in a log file for future reference with the current date.

Prerequisites

    A Linux-based system with Bash shell.
